# dnsmasq configuration

# Add local-only domains here, queries in these domains are answered
# from /etc/hosts or DHCP only.
local=/{{ DOMAIN }}/

# Add domains which you want to force to an IP address here.
# The example below send any host in keizerlijk.eu to a local
# web-server.
address=/{{ DOMAIN }}/{{ SWARM_SHARED_IP }}

# Set the domain for dnsmasq. this is optional, but if it is set, it
# does the following things.
# 1) Allows DHCP hosts to have fully qualified domain names, as long
#     as the domain part matches this setting.
# 2) Sets the "domain" DHCP option thereby potentially setting the
#    domain of all systems configured by DHCP
# 3) Provides the domain part for "expand-hosts"
