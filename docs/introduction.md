# Introduction

To get started with 10homelab, you will need the following:

- A public IPv4 address
- A public domain
- The internal IP CIDR `10.x.y.z/16` (so, choose a static number for X, like your house street number)
  - Throughout the documentation, you will see references to `10.69.y.z`; substitute the `69` with your own number.
